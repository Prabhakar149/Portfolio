          The provision of efficient, low cost, reliable and safe transport infrastructure and services assumes additional significance in India because resources and markets are dispersed across long distances. The Road Transport industry has a lion’s share in India’s economic development. Due to easy accessibility, flexibility of operations, door to door service and reliability, Road Transport in India showed an increase in share of both passenger and freight traffic vis-à-vis other modes of transport. In fact, the progress of a nation and progress of its transport industry is complementary to each other.

        <h2>Impact of modern transport on industrialized countries</h2>
        <p>
          The movement from the bicycle to the modern forms of transport has been both, boon, and an impediment. The positive elements of the developments within transportation over the years have more than adequately made up for the negative aspects. This later position is slowly being undermined because of the increase in gasoline consumption, which has both economic and environmental concerns. Additionally, the horrendous traffic jams, which occur in some urban centers, diminish the travel experience. However, despite some mild irritants the overwhelming position is that modern transport has improved the life of most citizens and has reshaped the world into a smaller and more vibrant community.

            Transport Planning Models: Passenger and Freight Transport
          </h2>
          <p>
            Transportation is a fundamental component of society today, capable of yielding massive economic and social benefits but also equally capable of producing extremely costly negative externalities. Proper policies need to be put in place to minimize the externalities while taking full advantage of the benefits. Proper policies can only be devised through the use of appropriate and well-thought out transportation models.

            Freight and passenger transport systems usually move in separate nodes, which implies that their structures are quite different from each other, and so are the designs of their models (Hofstra University, 2014). The differences are, however, more pronounced at the respective terminals, which often concern different locations and different facilities (Hofstra University, 2014). The rationale behind the operational differences between freight and passenger transportation systems is that whereas "each passenger is an independent decision-making unit, each load of freight must be managed…
